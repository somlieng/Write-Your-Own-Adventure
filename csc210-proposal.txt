CSC 210 Final Project Proposal
Title: Write-Your-Own-Adventure Game
Team Members: Som Euakarn Liengtiraphan, Jeff Hrebenach, Evan Lea
*********************************************************************
Project Description:

The idea for this project is based off Reddit and the Fan fiction 
culture of reimagination and collaboration. We plan to build a 
write-your-own-adventure portal where participants choose from various 
starting prompts and write their own short stories. After the stories 
are built, these stories will be hosted on the website for all other 
users to see and accompanied with an upvoting system that users can 
use to vote for their favorite recreations. After a certain limit, 
those new short stories will be become new starting prompts. 

Requirement Fulfillment:

Create: Users will need to create an account to be able to post 
their stories on the website. Through their account, they would 
also be able to view all the stories they have written and other 
statistics.

Read: Users will be able to read all of the stories, which is 
stored in a database on the server, through the website

Update: Users will be able to create more stories and update 
their user account data on the website

Delete: Users will be able to delete their stories and 
their account on this website

Of course, all of the above will be run through Ajax. 

If we have time, it would also be a good feature to create an 
online web chat service through WebSockets to enable more 
collaboration between the many users.

Target Audience:

This website is targeted to people who loves to write and share 
their writing. There is no specific age target, because you can 
love to write whether you are 7 or your are 77. An idea we also had 
was to section off certain parts of the site for different ages, to 
prevent inappropriate material and language. 

This project is a solution to:

This website would provide a platform for emerging writers to hone 
their skills. It will also help writers to overcome writer's block 
by allowing them to expand on existing storylines and challenge 
them by making them write about topic they might be less comfortable 
with.

Uniqueness of Project:

This project would expand on the minimum requirements by 
implementing a specialized comment section and a basic voting 
system. The website will aim to provide a space on the web where 
creative writers can share and learn, which so far is not 
extensively present.
